Gender and Climate Change: Data-Driven Solutions
Overview
This website models the relationship between gender inequality and climate change using open-source data to propose actionable solutions. Our aim is to highlight the disproportionate impacts of climate change on marginalized communities, particularly women, while promoting climate action that also advances gender equality.

Key Features
Interactive Data Visualizations: Explore the intersection of gender inequality and climate change through global and localized trends.
Case Studies: In-depth analysis of specific regions, such as the gendered impact of climate-driven drought on pastoralist societies in Africa.
Solution Proposals: Actionable recommendations for policy-makers, organizations, and communities to mitigate both gender inequality and climate risks.
Problem Scope
Climate change disproportionately affects women, especially in marginalized and vulnerable communities. From increased economic burdens to security challenges, the gendered impacts of climate change are often underreported and inadequately addressed. This website seeks to fill that gap by combining data-driven insights with practical, community-centered solutions.

Modeling the Gender and Climate Intersection
1. Macro-Level Analysis
Global Economic Impact: Study how climate disasters economically impact marginalized groups, particularly women, and propose solutions to reduce inequality.
Data Gaps and Bias: Highlight underreported gendered impacts of climate change and propose methods for improving data collection and accessibility.
2. Case Studies
Localized Gendered Impact: Examine the effects of climate-driven droughts on the gendered division of labor in pastoralist societies in African countries.
Community-Based Climate Mitigation Plans: Propose solutions such as climate-resilient agriculture and gender-sensitive policies that empower local women in vulnerable regions.
Potential Solutions
Improved Data Collection: Propose methods to collect and display gender and climate data, with a focus on eliminating algorithmic biases and filling the gender data gap.
Community-Specific Mitigation Plans: Develop localized strategies for mitigating climate impacts, incorporating traditional knowledge and addressing the unique needs of women in the community.
Policy Recommendations: Suggest policy changes that promote gender-responsive climate action, including access to climate adaptation resources for women in affected regions.
Data Sources
NASA SEDAC: Data from NASA's Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center on climate change and socioeconomic factors.
UN Sustainable Development Goals: Relevant SDGs related to gender equality and climate action.
